🧠 NSAP Scheme Classification Model using IBM AutoAI

📌 Project Overview

The National Social Assistance Program (NSAP) is a government welfare program in India that provides financial support to elderly individuals, widows, and persons with disabilities from below-poverty-line (BPL) households. This project uses IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI to automatically build a classification model that helps identify the most appropriate scheme for each applicant based on their demographic and socio-economic details.


⚙️ Key Features

🔍 Predicts NSAP scheme codes based on applicant data

✅ Automated data cleaning, feature engineering, and model optimization using AutoAI

📊 Evaluation using classification metrics like accuracy and F1-score

☁️ One-click deployment on IBM Cloud

👨‍💻 No manual coding required — built through AutoAI interface


🛠️ Technology Used

IBM Watson Studio (AutoAI)

IBM Cloud for deployment

Dataset provided for NSAP applicants with features like:

Gender, Caste Category, State, District

Mobile Ownership, Aadhaar Status

Number of Dependents, Scheme Code


🚀 How It Works

Data Collection – Historical applicant data including demographics and socio-economic details.

AutoAI Process – Handles preprocessing, selects best algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost), and ranks pipelines.

Model Deployment – Best pipeline is deployed as a web service for real-time predictions.

Evaluation – Performance is assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
